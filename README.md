# Musability

My vision for Musability is to help people who have an interest in Music use this website to help attain their goal with singing and guitar (for now).
Starting this project I find it especially hard to Sing in pitch. This inspired me to create this website. My goal for this website is to create lots of features that help with Singing and Guitar (for now), as well as to learn full stack development.
This is my first big project and I want to be able to learn as much as I can from it.
I will learn using AI and Youtube videos to make sure I can understand how every line of code works.
